# Go Nil Map Panic

This repository demonstrates a common error in Go: panics caused by accessing elements in a nil map.  The `bug.go` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.go` provides a corrected version.

The issue arises from directly accessing a map's element without first checking if the map is initialized (i.e., `m == nil`).

This is a crucial consideration for robust Go programming, as unhandled panics can crash the application. The solution provides a safe way to access map values.
